<h2>Sorting</h2>
<ul><li>Quick Sort and Merge Sort</li></ul>
<ul><li>Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it</li></ul>
<ul><li>What common sorting functions are there? On what kind of input data are they efficient, when are they not? What does efficiency mean in these cases in terms of runtime and space used</li></ul>
<ul><li>in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic QuickSort / MergeSort / HeapSort answers</li></ul>
<h2>General Algorithms and DS</h2>
<ul><li>such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem. Be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Time Complexities and Space Complexities</li></ul>
<h2>Trees</h2>
<ul><li>binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees at the very least. You should be familiar with at least one flavor of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree</li></ul>
<ul><li>You should know about tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder</li></ul>
<ul><li>Heaps are incredibly useful. Understand their application and O() characteristics.</li></ul>
<h2>Graphs</h2>
<ul><li>here are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros/cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code</li></ul>
<h2>Recursion</h2>
<ul><li>Practice recursion and see the tradeoffs in complexities vs Iterative approach</li></ul>
<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<ul><li>processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Understand deadlock, livelock and how to avoid them</li></ul>
<ul><li>Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs</li></ul>
<ul><li>Understand how context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware</li></ul>
<ul><li>Know a little about scheduling</li></ul>
<ul><li>The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs</li></ul>
<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<ul><li>Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better.</li></ul>
<h2>Article: Google Internship:</h2>
<p>“How big could the input be?” “What
happens with bad inputs?” and “How
often will we run this?</p>
<p>One of the most important things
you should know is Big O notation
and the analysis it represents</p>
<p>As
you know, code that works perfectly but
is very hard for others to read is usually
not a good idea in team-based software
development. We are not worried about
handwriting, but we do actively look for
clean, maintainable code</p>
<p>Testing code is important when
working as an engineer, and it helps
in interviews, too. After writing code,
you should test it. Run a normal input, try the edge cases, and see if what
you wrote behaves properly.</p>
<p>Why do you
want to work for Google, and which
types of projects are the most interesting to you?</p>
<p>ask. Ask if they care about syntax, and if they do, try to get it right</p>
