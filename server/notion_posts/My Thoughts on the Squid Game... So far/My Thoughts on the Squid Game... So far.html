<h2>Initial Thoughts on the theme</h2>
<p>Let's be honest. We all have seen this before. The whole theme of taking your average civilian and putting them through some pretty traumatizing and pressing situations has been done over and over again. The whole theme of the show screams, in my opinion, hunger games. I don't know for sure but I swear the guy with the whole black mask (very cool by the way) just reminds me of the game maker. You know, that weird looking guy that has ocean waves for a beard?</p>

<p>At least the game maker in Squid Game has some what of a cool looking appearance to him. I mean man, would you look at the contours on this guy's mask!?</p>

<p>Now that is a menacing, ominous and perplexing looking antagonist.</p>
<h2>The First Game</h2>
<p>Again I always have to be 100% honest with my readers (if there are any). I knew from the start of the first episode that people were going to die. I just could tell. Ever since that strange man came up to the main character in the subway station. Being invited to play for relatively larger sums of money than the 100,000 yuan he earned smells fishy to me. Do you really think that a group of 'elite' people would simply just give away billions of CAD to any random off the street? Of course not, you need to fight for that money.</p>
<p>When they first stepped into that room with the doll I was so excited to see why everyone was hyping up this show so much. As soon as that guy was called out, I knew, my suspicions were true. He was shot and killed. I can't say I did not see it coming. But I knew in the back of my head that it would be pandemonium when everyone realized what was really happening. It would click in their desperate, broke, stretched out minds that this was for real. The price of earning all of that money. Would be death!</p>

<p>Not gonna lie. This is the funniest looking game I have ever seen. I mean who thought of this?</p>
<h2>Theories</h2>
<p>The one thing that I noticed about the game maker was when final preparations were completed to begin the first game. He made a call in his chamber saying, "Final preparations are completed. We are ready to begin the first phase". To me I think he must have been talking to a boss or higher power. Could this be some sort of government operation? Where instead of having to lock people in prison or to seize their assets. They just kill them? Could this be some sort of mass extermination of the poor and financially inclined? Could it be a way for the country to rid of debt? Or could it be a group of sadistic rich bastards who get off on the poor piggies being slaughtered for 'pocket change'. The possibilities are endless. All I know is that these games are a life and death situation. </p>
<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>I wonder what the next episodes will have in store? It is always very enjoyable to find a new series to really get into and dissect. I will try to keep up with these random thoughts. I know probably nobody will ever read these things so I am going to have some fun with it! I hope to see you in my next review. </p>
