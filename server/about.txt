Hi, I'm James!

I am currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Guelph. I am currently
working at <a href="https://system1.com/">System1</a> as a Full Stack Developer using technologies such as Angular, C#, SQL and AWS cloud platform.
<br>
<br>
Since you're already here, you might also be interested in some of the projects I've worked on, or perhaps the things I've <a href="/">rambled</a> about. Perhaps you'd even like to see my resume, who knows?
<br>
<br>
If you'd like to get in touch, you can contact <a href="mailto:jimmylemieux9@gmail.com">jimmylemieux9@gmail.com</a>, or ping me on Discord stem#5746
